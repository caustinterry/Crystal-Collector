# Crystal Collector

A game built using jQuery that randomly geneates an number as well as a random number assigned to each crytal. When the crystal is clicked it will add that randome value to the Total Score. Once the Total Score matches the Random Number the wins will increase. If the Total Score goes over the losses will increase.
